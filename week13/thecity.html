Besides the fact that the weather is still lovely (homage!), there are plenty of parties and street parties in Paramaribo between Christmas and New Years. Plenty of boombuses drive by (with rock music on the roof), brass bands parade through the streets and people dance through the streets.
                         On New Year's Eve, a huge fireworks spectacle takes place from 12:00 in the afternoon and the Domineestraat is closed for an annual Pagara relay where fireworks are fired for miles.
                         Too much noise? Don't worry: earplugs are even handed out for the exploding fireworks. End the evening at 't Vat where it's one big party!.</p>
                         
                           <div class="weapon"></div> <img  src="images/weaponofsuriname.png" alt="weapon" > <p>The coat of arms of Suriname consists of two Indigenous people who hold a shield. The shield consists of a number of parts.
                            On the left, a sailing ship Symbolizes the history of Suriname. The palm tree on the right represents the present but also justice. In the center of the shield is a diamond, which represents the heart. In the center of the diamond, a five-pointed star indicates the areas where the inhabitants of Suriname come from . At the bottom of the coat of arms is the motto
                            Justitia , Pietas , Fides. This means:
                            Justice, Love and Faithfulness. That the Indians are the first inhabitants of our country. And that our ancestors came from Africa, Asia and Europe</p>

                    <div class="staatsolie"></div><img src="images/columbus1.png" alt="columbus" ><p>In the fifteenth century, various indigenous groups lived in Suriname, such as the Arawaks and the Caribs. 
                    Columbus reached America in 1492, European countries conquer large parts of the American continent in search of gold. 
                    The conquests claimed the lives of millions of inhabitants of South America as a result of wars and the infectious diseases brought with them such as measles and smallpox. 
                    Spaniards, English and French are also trying to settle in present-day Suriname. 
                    In 1651, the English established the first sugar and tobacco plantations in the area.The Netherlands initially focuses on trade in Asia.
                     Commissioned by the Netherlands, the English navigator Henry Hudson and his crew are looking for a 
                    new trade route to Asia via the northeast. When they come across ice, he decides to look for a route through America. 
                    They sail to the east coast of North America. With the ship Halve Maen, the navigators sailed on September 11, 1609 up the river that we now know as the
                    Hudson.The explorers' findings aroused the interest of Dutch traders. They founded trading posts and established the West India Company (WIC) in 1621. 
                    The WIC obtained a monopoly on all trade in the west from the Dutch state. 
                    The area around the Hudson is renamed New Amsterdam, where some villages arise, including Breukelen (Brooklyn) and Heemstede (Hempstead).

                    <h2>Walking for four days in a group</h2><div class="local"></div><img src="images/groupwalking.png" alt="walking" > <p>For months we had 2 Zumba classes every week, in which we trained for the AVD. During the lessons we learned 3 different dances, which were really fun to study in.
                    We got to know a lot of people, all very friendly. Both younger and older ladies danced along.
                    
                    On March 3, the time had come. The evening four days had begun. The first day we gathered at 2:30 PM in front of Cindy's amusement park. This was not that far from the assembly point where we were supposed to start.The Evening Four Days Marches is actually the carnival of Paramaribo. We walked 10 to 13 km through the city for four days. Along the way we danced simple steps that had not been rehearsed. Only at the hot spots (one to three a night), we did one of our dances for which we had learned so long.

                    On the way we got water or juice, a currant bun and a meat roll for dinner. 
                    
                    It was very nice, only I was often addressed as bakra, which he doesn't really like. But hey, I'm just white and I can't and won't change that now. 
                    
                    The sponsor for our group was McDonald's, strange for a fitness club to be sponsored by a fast food chain, but yes. The week after on Thursday we ended up together at the Mc and we all got a burger and a pack of fries.
                    
                    It was a really nice experience, especially the atmosphere was good (when the music was playing). It was exhausting, but worth it.

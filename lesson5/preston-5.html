            <h3>First Settlers and Early History </h3>
            <img src="images/prestonfirst.jpg" alt="first settlers">
            <p>Elisha R. Laurence</p>
            <p>Located on the flat, at the junction of Highways 91 and 36 is the county seat of Franklin County:
                Preston, Idaho. Prior to 1881, the flat was known as “Worm Creek” [pronounced “crick”]. Those that
                settled this area were predominantly Mormon and their leadership came from the LDS Church President in
                Salt Lake City, Utah. The name Preston was chosen for the area in the following manner as recorded by
                Baltzer Peterson: </p>
            <p>On May 14, 1881, a special meeting was held. Some of the Church Leaders at Salt Lake City objected to the
                name “Worm Creek” as pertaining to any Church Organization. They thought that a more appropriate name
                should be given the Ward for they were not in favor of the name “Worm” being used when it pertained to
                anything connected with the Church. Mrs. Rachel Porter, wife of Bishop Porter, had the privilege of
                suggesting the name “Preston” in honor of Bishop William B. Preston of the Cache Stake, and who later
                became the presiding Bishop of the Church. Thus Preston became the name of the Ward and the Community.
            </p>
            <p>The first permanent residence within the present city limits of Preston was established by Dennis W. Winn
                in 1868. He built a frame home 32 by 16 feet. The house was located a mile southeast of the city center.
                Due to the lack of water on the sand ridge or the Preston Flat, settlements had surrounded the Flat
                before the first homes were built there.</p>
            <p>Homesteaders were especially moving closer from the southeast and east due to the filling up of available
                quarter section homesteads along Worm Creek. Other early settlers in the area were: Alfred Alder, David
                Boyce, Thomas Bennett, William Bennett, William Bell, Hans M Lund, Benjamin Lamont, Anna Lundgren,
                William D. Millar, James Miller, Christen Mortensen, Claus Clausen, James Chadwick, Ephraim Ellsworth,
                Joseph Poster, George Poster, William Gibbons, Joseph Golightly, Willard Green, Anders Mortensen, J. O.
                Paton, Hyrum Nielsen, Joseph Nielsen, Hans Nisson, Hop Pender, Shem Purnell, Ernest Purnell, Ole
                Petersburg, Andrew Garrison, James R. Hebdon, G. Halverson, J. Harris, Martin Higley, Amelious Hansen,
                Elum Hollingsworth, Eil Petterborg, Joseph S. Sharp, George Shaffer, Allen Tatum, Robert Wayman, Charles
                West, Alfred Willhelm, John Winn and James Winn. </p>
            <h3>Education </h3>
            <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="first school">
            <p>Before the construction of the Worm Creek School, homes or private facilities of the people had were used
                to educate their children. The first community school was conducted in 1877 in Robert M. Hull’s log
                granary. Verena Foster, a girl of sixteen, was the first teacher. As with all early schools, her
                subjects were the three R’s and spelling. Books had to be shared and pencil and slate were used to
                record the new learning. The new log school building was ready in 1879 with Mary Heller as the first
                teacher. </p>

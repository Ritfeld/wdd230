            <p>A crisis can slow down the economy, but it cannot stop it. There are opportunities in every economic
                environment,
                and this “new normal” suddenly thrust upon us is no different. When others in your industry scale back or
                shut down,
                your business can be the one to emerge at the forefront. A strong voice in a quiet room. And when the
                rebound begins,
                and that room fills again with marketing noise, who do you think will have the easiest time getting people
                to listen?
                Be ready to lead during the rebound with Baer Performance Marketing!
